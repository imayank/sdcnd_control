Initially the error is small and cumulative error is also negligible so it is the proportional coefficient responsible to supply the control. After some time a little bit of error starts accumulating, which very slightly pushes the error towards zero. Mainly it is the proportional coefficient which is affecting the resultant steering control. \n",

    "It is the steer curve- the control calculated by PID controller. Initially the vehicle has to move towards left lane due to vehicle in front in its current lane. That's why there is a control value of about -0.04. As the vehicle starts to follow its trajectory, not much steer is needed, that's why the curve stays near zero value. It almost mirrors the error because the proportional coefficient is considerably larger than the integral coefficient and as the proportional coefficient value is 2.0 the steer control is almost the double in magnitude of error."
